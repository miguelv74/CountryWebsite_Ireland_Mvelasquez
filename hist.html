        <h1>HISTORY</h1>
        <h3>Prehistoric peoples and later Celtic groups created a Gaelic society of small kingdoms, with early Christian monasteries turning Ireland into a center of learning and art.​
Viking raids from the 8th century led to trading towns like Dublin, which were later absorbed into an Irish-Norse mix.​
Anglo-Norman and then English expansion from the 12th century gradually brought most of the island under English control, reinforced by plantations and harsh laws that deepened religious and land divisions.​
The 19th century saw union with Great Britain, the catastrophic Great Famine, and massive emigration that spread the Irish diaspora worldwide.​
Armed rebellion and political organizing in the early 1900s produced the Easter Rising, the War of Independence, partition, and a 26-county state that became the Republic of Ireland, while Northern Ireland remained in the UK and later experienced the Troubles and a peace process.
