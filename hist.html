        <h1 class="underline">HISTORY</h1>
        <h3>Prehistoric peoples and later Celtic groups created a Gaelic society of small kingdoms, with early Christian monasteries turning Ireland into a center of learning and art.​
Viking raids from the 8th century led to trading towns like Dublin, which were later absorbed into an Irish-Norse mix.​
Anglo-Norman and then English expansion from the 12th century gradually brought most of the island under English control, reinforced by plantations and harsh laws that deepened religious and land divisions.​
The 19th century saw union with Great Britain, the catastrophic Great Famine, and massive emigration that spread the Irish diaspora worldwide.​
Armed rebellion and political organizing in the early 1900s produced the Easter Rising, the War of Independence, partition, and a 26-county state that became the Republic of Ireland, while Northern Ireland remained in the UK and later experienced the Troubles and a peace process.

        </h3>
        <h1 class="underline">IMPORTANT MOMENTS</h1>
        <h3>Medieval conquest and colonisation
1169–1171: The Norman invasion and Henry II’s arrival begin centuries of English involvement and feudal colonisation in Ireland.​

1601–1607: Defeat at the Battle of Kinsale and the Flight of the Earls end the old Gaelic order and open Ulster to large‑scale English and Scottish plantation.​

17th–19th century upheavals
1641–1691: The Confederate and Williamite wars, including the Battle of the Boyne and Battle of Aughrim, cement Protestant Ascendancy and harsh penal laws against Catholics.​

1801: The Acts of Union abolish the Irish Parliament and fold Ireland into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.​

1845–1849: The Great Famine causes over a million deaths and mass emigration, transforming Irish society and global diaspora.​

Revolution and partition
1916: The Easter Rising in Dublin asserts a republican claim to independence and, after the executions, reshapes public opinion.​

1919–1921: The War of Independence leads to the Anglo‑Irish Treaty, creating the Irish Free State and formalising partition with Northern Ireland.​

1922–1923: The Irish Civil War over the Treaty decides the new state’s direction and leaves a lasting political divide.​

Building the state
1937–1949: A new constitution redefines the state as “Ireland,” and the Republic of Ireland Act finally ends remaining constitutional ties to the British crown.​

1973: Ireland joins the European Economic Community, reshaping its economy and external relationships.​

Northern Ireland and recent change
Late 1960s–1998: The Troubles in Northern Ireland bring decades of conflict, ending with the 1998 Good Friday (Belfast) Agreement and a new power‑sharing system.​

1990s–2010s: The Celtic Tiger boom, subsequent financial crisis and IMF‑EU bailout, and social referendums such as the 2015 vote for same‑sex marriage mark rapid economic and cultural change.</h3>
